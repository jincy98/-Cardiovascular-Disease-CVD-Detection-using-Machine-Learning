# 🫀 Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) Detection using Machine Learning

## 🔍 Project Overview

This project focuses on the **early detection of cardiovascular disease (CVD)** using various machine learning algorithms. By leveraging patient health records and behavioral data, we aim to build predictive models that can assist in **risk assessment and early intervention**, potentially reducing long-term complications and mortality.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Build and evaluate multiple ML models for predicting CVD
* Compare performance using key metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and ROC AUC
* Identify the most suitable algorithm for deployment in real-world healthcare applications

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Support Vector Machine (SVM)
* AdaBoost
* Gradient Boosting
* XGBoost

---

## 📊 Performance Summary

The **Gradient Boosting model** showed the best performance with:

* ✅ F1 Score: **0.699**
* ✅ ROC AUC: **0.794**

It outperformed other models like XGBoost, AdaBoost, and Logistic Regression, making it the most suitable choice for reliable CVD prediction.
